# ShroomBot

## Overview
Senior Design Project for a group of us started in 2019. 
The aim of the project is to create a robot to pick mashroom in mashroom farms, so that it would work 24/7 with onboard cameras and algorithm to pick target mushrooms at its "perfect" time. It would also relief the pressure of worker shortage at the time.
